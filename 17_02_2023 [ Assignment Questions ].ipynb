    "### Question no.1: What is MongoDB ? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases ?\n",
    "### Answer: MongoDB is a popular non-relational database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional rows and columns. MongoDB is known for its ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data and its scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not follow the traditional relational database model based on tables and rows. Instead, they use different data models that allow for more flexibility in storing and querying data. Some common types of NoSQL databases include document-oriented databases like MongoDB, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where there is a need for:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Scalability: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, meaning that it can handle increasing amounts of data simply by adding more nodes to a cluster, whereas traditional SQL databases are vertically scalable and require more powerful hardware to handle increasing amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Flexibility: MongoDB's flexible document-based data model allows for storing different types of data with different structures within a single collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.High availability: MongoDB provides automatic sharding and replica sets, making it easier to achieve high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Real-time analytics: MongoDB's ability to handle unstructured data and provide real-time analytics makes it ideal for applications where real-time data processing and analysis is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Rapid development: MongoDB's schema-less data model makes it easier and faster to develop and iterate on new applications and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### However, SQL databases are still preferred in scenarios where transactions are the primary concern or where strict data consistency is required. Additionally, SQL databases may be better suited for applications where complex queries and relationships between data are necessary."

    "### Question no.2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "### Answer: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that provides several features that make it a good choice for handling large amounts of unstructured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are JSON-like data structures that can have a flexible schema. This allows for easier handling of unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Horizontal scaling: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, meaning that it can handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple servers. This allows for high availability and performance even as the amount of data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing of fields in documents, which allows for faster queries and improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data aggregation, filtering, and analysis. This is especially useful for applications that require real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Ad-hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad-hoc queries, meaning that developers can query the data in any way they want without having to predefine a schema or schema structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.Replication and high availability: MongoDB provides built-in replication and high availability features that ensure data redundancy and minimal downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.Flexible data model: MongoDB's flexible data model allows for storing different types of data with different structures within a single collection, making it easier to handle complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.Schema-less design: MongoDB has a schema-less design, which means that it can handle changing data structures without requiring any modifications to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall, MongoDB's document-oriented data model, horizontal scaling, indexing, and flexible data structures make it an ideal choice for handling large amounts of unstructured data, and its aggregation framework and ad-hoc querying capabilities make it well-suited for real-time analytics and complex data analysis."
